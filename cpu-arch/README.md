Important note: creating this simulation was done as part of the course CMSC 22200: Computer Architecture, taught by Professor Yanjing Li at the University of Chicago.

I have only published the code I've written along with a basic Linux shell implementation - the code itself will not compile on its own as it requires extensive dependencies and requirements unique to the University of Chicago's Computer Science Department's linux servers.

Please do not distribute this code or use it as your own - it's merely posted to highlight a project that I really enjoyed working on! Copying this code or using it for your own purposes will inevitably get you caught and result in serious consequences.
