This project was completed as part of my computer architecture class. For this class, we had to design and construct a CPU within a C simulation. The project was broken down into 4 labs. 

- The first lab consisted of developing a single-cycle CPU. 
- The second implemented a pipelined 5-cycle CPU design, along with data dependencies and stalling for control path instructions. 
- The third lab involved integrating a branch prediction methodology to better improve processor speed for branch instructions. 
- The fourth lab involved implementing two level-1 caches for both the memory and instruction set.

All the code can be found inside of labs 1-4, with the source code found inside of the src/ sub-directory of each folder. All the other files present involve testing our scripts and ensuring that the code was fully functioning.
