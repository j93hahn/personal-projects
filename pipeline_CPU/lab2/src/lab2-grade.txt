In section 1 (7 tests): cycle by cycle results (rdump + mdump) is checked and it should exactly match the reference sim. For each test input, if the only mismatch is "Instructions Retired", 90% of the points are awarded. If all the cycles match, full points are awarded. If there are mismatches but no more than 2, 90% of the points are awarded. Otherwise, if more than 70% of the cycles match, 70% of the points are awarded. If between 40%-70% of the cycles match, 40% of the points are awarded. Otherwise, no points are awarded.
step1-a-input (10 points)
step1-b-input (10 points)
step2-a-input (12.5 points)
step2-b-input (12.5 points)
step3-input (15 points)
final_test.s (15 points)
final_test-2.s (15 points)



section 2 (2 hidden test cases): the final results are checked. For each test input, if the only mismatch is "Instructions Retired", 80% of the points are awarded. If everything matches, full points are awarded. Otherwise, no points are awarded.
